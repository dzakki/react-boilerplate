# React Boilerplate

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is an opinionated React boilerplate. It uses:

  - [StandardJS](https://github.com/standard/standard) for linting
  - [Flow](https://flow.org) for type checking
  - [Redux](https://redux.js.org) and specifically Redux Toolkit for state management
  - [Bulma](https://bulma.io) for styling
  - [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for navigation

Folder structure is based on [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design) methodology by [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/).
